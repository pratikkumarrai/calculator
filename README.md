1. Introduction

This project is a Simple Calculator application developed using Python and Tkinter (a standard GUI library).The application provides an easy-to-use interface for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. Main Objectives

•	To create an interactive and user-friendly calculator GUI using Python

•	To demonstrate the use of Tkinter widgets and event handling.

•	To handle invalid inputs and common errors effectively.

3. Software Design

•	Programming Language: Python 3.x

•	GUI Library: Tkinter

•	Design Pattern: Event-driven programming model

The application is designed in a modular fashion with separate functions handling calculations and UI updates.

4. System Design

•	Input: Two numeric values entered by the user.

•	Processing: Selected arithmetic operation is performed based on user input.

•	Output: Displays the result in a label on the GUI.

The system ensures error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero through pop-up error messages.

5. Functionalities Implemented

•	Accepts two numeric inputs from the user.

•	Provides an option menu to select an operation: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/).

•	Calculates and displays the result in real-time.

•	Handles errors such as:

o	Non-numeric inputs.

o	Division by zero.

6. Workflow

.	User enters the first and second numbers in the respective input fields.

.	User selects an arithmetic operation from the dropdown menu.

.	User clicks on the Calculate button.

.	The program performs the calculation and displays the result.

.	If there is any error (e.g., invalid input or division by zero), an appropriate error message is shown.

 7. Sample Input/Output
  •	Sample Input:

Invalid input examples:

 •	Input: abc (non-numeric value)

 •	Output: Error message: "Invalid input. Please enter numeric values."
 
  Division By zero example:

 •	Input: Second number: 0

 •	Output: Error message: "Division by zero is not allowed."

 8. Advantages

•	User-friendly and intuitive GUI.

•	Clear separation of UI and logic.

•	Robust error handling for common input mistakes.

•	Lightweight and easy to run on any system with Python installed.

9. Limitations

•	Supports only basic arithmetic operations.

•	No support for decimal precision control.

•	No support for advanced mathematical functions (e.g., square root, exponentiation).

10. Future Enhancements

•	Add support for additional operations like modulus, square root, and power.

•	Implement a history feature to track previous calculations.

•	Add keyboard shortcuts for faster input.

•	Improve UI design with themes (light/dark modes).

•	Provide support for scientific mode.

11. Conclusion

This Simple Calculator project demonstrates the capability of Python's Tkinter library to create functional and user-friendly GUI applications. It serves as a good starting point for beginners to learn about event-driven programming, GUI development, and basic error handling.
